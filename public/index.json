[{"content":"Introduction This project started off in a microprocessor design class, I was taking Fall of 2024. The final project was to design and create a capacitance meter. The specifications that we needed to meet were along these lines.\nMeasure within 1% accuracy Custom Designed PCB Accurate mesurments between pico farads to hundreds of micro farads Does not need an external computer to operate Uses to leads to perform measurements Implements auto ranging functionality A measurement must be made within 5ms Theory Of Operation To be able to measure across a wide range of values while keeping high accuracy. We needed to develop our own method of measurement.\nWe used two techniques to cover the low and high capacitance values a 555 Astable Multivibrator and a RC charging circuit.\n555 Astable Multivibrator If your not an EE or a CE the name of this method probably sounds a bit intimidating. So let me break it down.\nA 555 timer is an integrated circuit that can be used to produce, time delays, oscilators, and PWM signals. Astable means the signal produced by the 555 doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any external trigger to switch states. Multivibrator means the signel produced by the 555 timer switches between a high and low state.\nIn sum all a 555 Astable Multivibrator means is that the timer produces a square wave.\nIn the 555 timer data sheet it gives a layout that produces a square wave. It also adds the corresponding equation to calcualte the frequency of oscilation.\nLayout Equation \\begin{aligned} f \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{1.4R_cC} \\end {aligned} We can re-arrange this equation to get the following. \\begin {aligned} C \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{1.4R_cf} \\end {aligned} So, if we know the Resistor value and can accuratly measure the frequency we can then calculate capacitance.\nRC Charging Circuit \\begin{aligned} I \u0026amp;= \\frac{V_b}{R} e^{\\frac{-t}{RC}} \\end{aligned}\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/projects/capacitancemeter/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project started off in a microprocessor design class, I was taking Fall of 2024.\nThe final project was to design and create a capacitance meter.\nThe specifications that we needed to meet were along these lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMeasure within 1% accuracy\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCustom Designed PCB\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAccurate mesurments between pico farads to hundreds of micro farads\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes not need an external computer to operate\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUses to leads to perform measurements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImplements auto ranging functionality\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA measurement must be made within 5ms\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"theory-of-operation\"\u003eTheory Of Operation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be able to measure across a wide range of values while keeping high accuracy.\nWe needed to develop our own method of measurement.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Making a Capacitance Meter"}]
